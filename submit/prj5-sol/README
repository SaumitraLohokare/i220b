LRU and RANDOM work as expected, but MRU seems to produce incosistent results.
I am making sure to use a the list of lines as a "stack" to make sure I get the
most recently used line (Also every time we get a hit I am updating the stack to 
put that line on the top), but it still seems to give not correct results.
