The sos-with-spaces test did not work as expected. If the files start with spaces
my code is currently ignoring those spaces. Also while testing by myself, files 
with multiple lines do not work as expected, all the lines appear on the same line
after the decoding.

Simply run `make` to make the code, or if it does not work `make all` should work.
